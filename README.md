# Fight-Game-with-GUI
2 player fight game with GUI
Fight Club is a full GUI without threading, ran into issues changing windows for the right sequences so I 
created "Fight Club 2" where I experiment and attempt to impliment threading to help the panels shift when needed.

UPDATE 1/27/2025
I have returned to this project after not touching it for 2 years. While I've fixed my primary issue, I never realized how messy and convoluted the code is. 17 year old me has be bested today, but I'll be back to fix it. Or destroy everything and start from scratch, we'll see.
